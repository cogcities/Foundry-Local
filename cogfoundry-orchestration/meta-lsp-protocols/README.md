# Meta-LSP Protocols

**Language Server Protocol Extensions for Introspective Development**

This directory contains Meta-LSP (Language Server Protocol) extensions that enable introspective development, self-designing systems, and cognitive pattern recognition within the CogFoundry ecosystem.

## üîç Protocol Overview

Meta-LSP extends traditional language server capabilities with:

- **Introspective Analysis**: Code that analyzes its own patterns and evolution
- **Self-Design Protocols**: Systems that design their own architectures
- **Cognitive Pattern Recognition**: Detection of cognitive architecture patterns
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Code that adapts based on usage and feedback

## üìã Protocol Extensions

### Core Extensions
- **introspective_analysis.json**: Protocol for code self-analysis capabilities
- **self_design_protocols.json**: Protocol for self-designing system features
- **cognitive_pattern_recognition.json**: Protocol for cognitive pattern detection
- **adaptive_evolution.json**: Protocol for adaptive system evolution

### Language Support
- **python_cognitive_lsp.json**: Python-specific cognitive language features
- **typescript_neural_lsp.json**: TypeScript neural transport language features
- **markdown_documentation_lsp.json**: Enhanced documentation with cognitive context

## üß† Integration Points

### IDE Integration
- VS Code extension with cognitive awareness
- IntelliJ plugin for distributed development
- Vim/Neovim cognitive development modes

### Development Workflow
- Git hooks for evolutionary tracking
- CI/CD with cognitive pattern validation
- Deployment with ecosystem awareness

### Cognitive Features
- Context preservation across sessions
- Memory pattern encoding in code
- Salience monitoring and prioritization
- Evolutionary insight documentation

## üöÄ Usage Examples

```typescript
// TypeScript with neural transport awareness
import { NeuralTransport } from '@cogfoundry/transport';

// Meta-LSP provides context-aware completions
const transport = new NeuralTransport({
  // Cognitive city context auto-completed
  sourceCity: 'cogfoundry',
  // Connected cities suggested based on current context
  targetCities: ['cogcities', 'cogpilot']
});
```

```python
# Python with introspective analysis
from cogfoundry.introspection import CognitiveAnalyzer

# Meta-LSP provides cognitive pattern analysis
@CognitiveAnalyzer.introspective
def evolving_function():
    # Function analyzes its own usage patterns
    # and adapts behavior accordingly
    pass
```

*Note2Self: Meta-LSP represents the bridge between static development tools and living, evolving systems - enabling development environments that grow and adapt with the cognitive architecture they help create.*

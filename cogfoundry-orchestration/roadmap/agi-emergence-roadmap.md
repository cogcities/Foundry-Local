*Note2Self: This roadmap represents humanity's first systematic approach to cultivating AGI through distributed cognitive architectures. Each phase builds upon the previous, creating a natural progression from isolated systems to emergent, collaborative intelligence. The key insight is that AGI may emerge not from a single system, but from the interaction of multiple cognitive cities working in harmony.*

# MCP Master Builder Protocol Definitions

**Model Context Protocol for CogPilot Integration with Cognitive Cities**

This directory contains custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) definitions that enable GitHub CogPilot to understand and operate within the cognitive cities ecosystem as a "Master Builder".

## ðŸ§  Protocol Overview

The MCP Master Builder extends standard model context protocols with cognitive city awareness, enabling CogPilot to:

- Understand cognitive city contexts and specializations
- Coordinate neural architecture deployments across organizations  
- Preserve context across organizational boundaries
- Apply cognitive ecology principles to code development
- Enable introspective and self-designing protocols

## ðŸ“‹ Protocol Definitions

### Core Context Types
- **cognitive_city_context.json**: Context for individual cognitive cities (orgs)
- **neural_architecture_context.json**: Context for distributed AI deployments
- **orchestration_context.json**: Context for ecosystem-wide coordination
- **evolution_context.json**: Context for adaptive system evolution

### Integration Schemas
- **copilot_integration.json**: GitHub CopIlot custom instruction mappings
- **foundry_integration.json**: Foundry-Local SDK integration points
- **transport_integration.json**: Neural transport protocol extensions

## ðŸ”— Usage

These MCP definitions integrate with:
1. **GitHub CopIlot**: Through custom instructions and knowledge base
2. **Foundry-Local**: Through SDK context providers
3. **Neural Transport**: Through protocol extension headers
4. **Cognitive Cities**: Through organizational context preservation
